# 🧠 Flash Card — Interactive Study Deck (Bootstrap Edition)

I was tasked to edit starter code to  do the following using **JavaScript** and **Bootstrap 5**

* toggle the  **Flip** button or the card itself to switch between the front and back.
* update the **counter** and **progress bar**  to reflect the current position.
* flip the **Front/Back badge** dynamically updates as cards are toggled.
* replace the card data with their own content.

## 🧩 Starter Details

I was provided:
* A **Bootstrap 5** layout with colorful styles.
* Working **Prev** and **Next** buttons.
* A card array (`cards[]`) to store front/back pairs.
* A partially complete `render()` function to update the UI.
